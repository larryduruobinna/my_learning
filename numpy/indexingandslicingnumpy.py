#  WHAT IS INDEXING:
# INDEXING MEANS PICKING ONE SPECIFIC VALUE FROM AN ARRAY. THINK OF IT LIKE HAVING 5 SENSORS ON A POWER LINE AND EACH SENSORS HAS A NUMBER  -- 0,1,2,3,4.    THE NUMBERS ARE CALLED THE INDEX
# EXAMPLE:

voltages = np.array([220, 230, 240, 250])
print(voltages[0])
print(voltages[1])
print(voltages[-1])



#  WHAT IS SLICING:
#  SLICING MEANS PICKING A RANGE OF VALUES. NOT JUST ONE.
# PYTHON EXAMPLE
voltages = [230, 240, 250, 260, 270]
print(voltages[1:4])
# you can see this prints from the second to the fourth because in python indexing starts from 0, meaning 0 is our 1 and 1 is our 2. also for slicing pythons doesnt print the last index.

# NUMPY EXAMPLE

voltages = np.array([210, 215, 240, 230, 220])
print(voltages[0:4])  # first 3 values
print(voltages[1:])  # from index 1 till the end 
print(voltages[:3])  # from start to index 3

# CHALLENGE
voltages = np.array([231, 229, 235, 228, 240, 222, 233])
print(voltages[0])
print(voltages[4])
print(voltages[-1])
print(voltages[2:5])
